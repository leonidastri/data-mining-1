# Data Mining Techniques -- WordCloud and Classification

## About

This is the first project of the course Data Mining Techniques developed by **Ritsogianni Argyro** and **Triantafyllou Leonidas** in the Spring semester of 2018. In this project we learned about some steps in Data Mining such as collection, pre-processing and transformation. We also implemented classification, using different classifiers such as Random Forests, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbor(our implementation using Majority Voting) and performed 10-fold Cross Validation measuring the following metrics: Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Accuracy. We used some tools and libraries which the instructors noted: SciKit Learn, pandas, gensim.This project is written in the programming language Python.

## Project Structure

* WordCloud implementation
* Classification using Random Forests, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbor(our implementation using Majority Voting)
* 10-fold Cross Validation measuring Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Accuracy
* Testing to find the best Classifier for our test set
